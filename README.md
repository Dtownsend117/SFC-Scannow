# SFC-Scannow
The SFC /scannow system scanner as a batch file
This is a small batch file that I whipped up while working on RISE to have a single command launch the scan instead of creating a process to open Command prompt and manually type SFC /scannow
The batch will need to be ran with admin rigts to function
